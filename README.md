# Streamlit-Deployment

**This project is an end to end implementation of a Bank Note authentication web application. We have containarized the entire application using Docker.**

**The entire project includes the following steps:**
1. Building a machine learning model for detecting whether a bank note is authentic. 
2. Building A Flask App For A Bank Note Authentication. It will use the trained ML pipeline to generate predictions on new data points in real-time.
3. Deploying Machine Learning Models Using Flask And Flasgger
4. Writing, Building And Running Docker Image. Build a Docker file on your local computer. This step is basically to create a docker image and container.
5. Commit the code in GITHUB
6. Create an account in Heroku.
7. Deploy the model. 
8. Web App is ready. 

**Important Note:**
**At the end of the day, docker is just a file with a few lines of instructions that are saved under your project folder with the name “Dockerfile”.**
